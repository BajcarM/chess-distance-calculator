Calculates and maps the distance for each figure. 

Just choose yor figure, place it on the board and calculator will compute number of steps needed to get to the other tiles.

You can resize the board to any size (square). Letter coords will react to the size over 26: A B C -> AA AB AC  and so on whatewer the size.

Dont worry text on tiles will resize accordingly ;-)
